### Title

Physiological derivatives BIDS proposal

### Short description and the goals for the BrainHack Vanderbilt

## INTRODUCTION

Physiopy is a community dedicated to developing solutions for handling physiological data acquired in neuroimaging setups. Currently, physiopy supports and maintains phys2bids, a library that standardizes raw physiological data in accordance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The community is also developing and managing other libraries like peakdet (processing and analysing), phys2denoise (producing physiological regressors for neuroimaging denoising), and physioQC (quality control). All those libraries produce a bunch of different derivatives. However, the derivatives structure and requirements for physiological data (i.e. cardiac, respiratory, blood pressure, etc.) are not yet covered by the BIDS specification. With this project, we are hoping to start a discussion around an eventual BIDS proposal on physiological derivatives.

This project does not require coding skills to join. If you are enthusiastic about physiological data, BIDS, both, or just a curious person, weâ€™re happy to have you on board!

## GOALS FOR THE BRAINHACK VANDERBILT

Open discussion on how to BIDSify physiological data derivatives (i.e. preprocessed data, peaks, troughs, rvt, hrv, etc.)
