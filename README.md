# BrainHack Vanderbilt 2024 Proposed Projects

Below is a brief overview of each proposed projects with links to their detailed documentation.

### BIDS Derivatives
- **Description**: Developing structure and requirements for physiological data, such as cardiac, respiratory, and blood pressure measurements, which are not yet covered by the current BIDS standards.
- **Details**: For more information, see [BIDS Derivatives](bids_derivatives.md).

### fMRI-EEG Preprocessing
- **Description**: Developing a preprocessing pipeline for concurrently collected functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) data.
- **Details**: Learn more in [fMRI-EEG Preprocessing](fmri-eeg-preproc.md).

### Neural Manifolds
- **Description**: Exploring neural manifold learning algorithms to analyze spiking ensembles in macaques performing learning tasks. 
- **Details**: Detailed insights can be found in [Neural Spiking Ensembles: Dynamics of Representational Geometry](manifold_tuning.md).

### Physiological Data Quality Assurance (PhysioQA)
- **Description**: A project dedicated to ensuring the quality of physiological data in research.
- **Details**: Read more about it in [PhysioQA Documentation](physioQA.md).

### Resting-State Networks Across Age
- **Description**: Investigating the changes in resting-state neural networks across different age groups.
- **Details**: For an in-depth understanding, refer to [RSN Across Age Documentation](rsn-across-age.md).
