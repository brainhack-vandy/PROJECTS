### Title

fMRI-EEG Preprocessing

### Short description and the goals for the BrainHack Vanderbilt

## INTRODUCTION

Preprocessing is a critical step in neuroimaging analysis, laying the foundation for accurate and meaningful scientific discoveries. We need help configuring a pipeline to quality check for multiple datasets. This project will allow attendees with or without experience handling fMRI/EEG data to get a chance to work with what we call the "raw data". Working on a QC pipeline includes devising visuals of what the data looks like at various stages to make sure that the preprocessing is working as you expected and the data collected is good quality for future analyses. Toolboxes used include AFNI, FSL, ANTs, chronux, etc.
